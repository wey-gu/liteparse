LiteParse is an open-source document parsing library that parses text with spatial layout information and bounding boxes. Written in Rust for speed and reliability, it runs entirely on your machine with no cloud dependencies, no LLMs, and no API keys.

LiteParse is designed specifically for use cases that require fast, accurate text parsing: real-time applications, coding agents, and local workflows. It provides a simple CLI and library API for parsing PDFs, Office documents, and images, with built-in OCR support.

## What can LiteParse do?

- **Parse PDFs** with precise spatial layout. Text comes back positioned where it appears on the page
- **Extract bounding boxes** for every text line, ready for downstream processing or visualization
- **OCR scanned documents** using built-in Tesseract or plug in your own OCR server
- **Parse Office files and images** with support for DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, PNG, JPG, and more via automatic conversion
- **Screenshot PDF pages** as high-quality images for LLM-based workflows
- **Use from Node.js/TypeScript, Python, Rust, or the browser (WASM)** — whatever fits your stack
