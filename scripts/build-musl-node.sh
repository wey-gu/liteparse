# so we need real clang + libc++ in the image (gcc/g++ from build-base is not enough).
# Alpine's libc++ links against llvm-libunwind (NOT the GNU libunwind, which conflicts).
# The libc++ runtime depends on libc++abi.so.1 too; that .so is shipped in the
# `libc++` package itself (no separate apk needed at build time, but we DO need
# to bundle the .so next to the .node for runtime — see the ldd loop below).
# Static libs (openssl-libs-static, zlib-static) are required because musl rust defaults
# to crt-static for build scripts.
